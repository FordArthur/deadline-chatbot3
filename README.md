## Getting started

Do, in the console:

```clj
(load "https://fordarthur.github.io/deadline-chatbot3/index.ix")
```
if you find an error mentioning "rbxts", doing
```clj
(dl.events.on_chat_message.connect start-script)
```
will fix the starting script not working

You'll then be guided through a starting script, that makes it easier to get started with the chatbot
