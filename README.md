# deadline-chatbot3

## Getting started

```clj
(load "https://fordfrthur.github.io/deadline-chatbot3") ; loads the chatbot into your game
```

You first have to ascend yourself (described in the in-game help) and then you should reset the nosu-cmds via the resetcmds command to prevent other people from doing the same.

## Things that will be added:

- Rtdm, a custom gamemode
